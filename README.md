Program Language & imports
    Python3 (python 3 only)
        import math

Execution Instruction
    
   NOTE: This program only runs on python3.x.x, python2 is not supported

   NOTE: If your python 3 environment is called python3 please use instruction 1, else use instruction 2

   NOTE: Flags are case sensitive only use capitalized flags ex.) -C -K -T -I -O


    #instruction 0
    python3 ./cipher.py -h
        #This instruction will print out description of the ciphers

    #instruction 1
    python3 ./cipher.py -C <Ciphername> -K <KEY> -T <ENC/DEC> -I <Inputfile> -O <OUTPUTFILE>

        or

    #instruction 2
    python ./cipher.py -C <Ciphername> -K <KEY> -T <ENC/DEC> -I <Inputfile> -O <OUTPUTFILE>

        The group implemented the project with the given cipher and thorougly explained to the other group members to fully understand the material.

        The flags were implemented to ensure that the user has a choice to what cipher to choose and to whether encrypt or decrypt
